# Spore - Better Editor Errors
This mod improves the errors you get upon trying to save or load an invalid creation.  
Without mods, most of them are just "This creation cannot be saved" - but they still use separate locale text, allowing me to replace them.  
Eventually, the mod will also add an option to disable Force Save.
